This is my first GitHub project
Is in Rails 3.2.14 and come from the need to have an inteface with
checkboxes to select different items and to have the capability collects some data on items if wanted.
So i achieve the results that i can add products, and create or update orders with products by checking boxes and add quantity that stay in the line_items table

See the Order and LineItem models and the _form partial in view/order  folder.
